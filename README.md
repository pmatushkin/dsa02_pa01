## Data Structures Programming Assignment 01: Basic Data Structures
### Problems
Practice implementing basic data structures and using them to solve algorithmic problems:
* [`/src/check_brackets_in_code/check_brackets.java`](src/check_brackets_in_code/check_brackets.java): Problem 1, Check brackets in the code, implements a feature for a text editor to find errors in the usage of brackets in the code;
* [`/src/tree_height/tree_height.java`](src/tree_height/tree_height.java): Problem 2, Compute tree height, reads a description of a tree from the input, implements the tree data structure, stores the tree and computes its height;
* [`/src/network_packet_processing_simulation/process_packages.java`](src/network_packet_processing_simulation/process_packages.java): Advanced Problem 3, Network packet processing simulation, implements a program to simulate the processing of network packets.
